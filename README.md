**5. Determine Deprecated/Unused Files/Directories**

Based on the analysis and the implemented changes, the following files are confirmed as no longer needed and should be removed:

1.  **`config.py`**: This contained logs, not configuration. All configuration is now in `config.yaml`.
2.  **`prompts/suitability_analysis.prompt`**: This is the older version of the suitability prompt. The active one is `prompts/job_suitability.prompt`.

**Action Required (File Removal):**

Execute these commands in your terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
git rm config.py
git rm prompts/suitability_analysis.prompt
git commit -m "Clean up: Remove unused config.py (logs) and old suitability_analysis.prompt"
git push origin main # Or your current branch
