## Help Support MyJobSpy üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíº

Hi there! I'm Kenneth Santoro ([kasnycdev](https://github.com/kasnycdev)), the creator and maintainer of **MyJobSpy**.

**What is MyJobSpy?**

MyJobSpy is an open-source Python application designed to streamline your job search. It scrapes job listings from popular platforms (like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) and uses AI (currently via Ollama) to analyze job descriptions and match them against your resume, helping you quickly identify the most relevant opportunities.

**Why Sponsor?**

Developing and maintaining MyJobSpy takes significant time and effort. The job market landscape is constantly shifting, and websites frequently update their structure, which means the scrapers need regular maintenance to keep working reliably. Furthermore, refining the AI matching prompts, adding support for new job sites, improving features, and responding to user feedback all require dedicated development time.

Your sponsorship allows me to dedicate more time to:

*   **Maintaining Scrapers:** Keeping up with website changes to ensure data collection remains functional.
*   **Improving AI Matching:** Refining prompts, exploring new models, and enhancing the relevance of job matches.
*   **Adding New Features:** Implementing user requests like support for more job sites, advanced filtering, or better reporting.
*   **Bug Fixes & Support:** Addressing issues reported by the community.
*   **Keeping MyJobSpy Free & Open Source:** Ensuring the tool remains accessible to everyone navigating the job market.

Essentially, your support directly fuels the continued development and improvement of MyJobSpy, helping make the often-daunting task of job searching a little easier for everyone.

**How Your Sponsorship Helps:**

Whether it's covering the cost of a coffee to power a late-night coding session or contributing towards potential future costs (like proxies for testing or cloud services), every bit helps motivate and enable further development.

Thank you for considering sponsoring MyJobSpy! Your support is greatly appreciated and makes a real difference. üôè
